        <br />
        During the pandemic I wanted totake advantage of my free time and began
        to learn about the technologies on which the WWW is built today. For the
        last 5 years I&apos;ve been learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and
        Javascript. <br />
        Also backend technologies like node.js, creating andconsuming APIs with
        JS and exploring some tools like Prisma.io (ORM), development of
        applications in the cloud and databases such as MongoDB and Postgresql
        for data storage required in the development of full-stack applications.
