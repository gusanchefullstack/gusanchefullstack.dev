        I&apos;m engineer in electronics and telecommunications graduated from
        the University of Cauca in Colombia, with +25 years of experience in
        technical, pre-sales and sales areas. For the last 5 years I&apos;ve
        been learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and Javascript but also
        libraries and frameworks like Tailwind.css and React.js <br />
        Also I learned about backend technologies like node.js, creating and
        consuming APIs with express.js and exploring some tools like Prisma.io
        (ORM), development of applications in the cloud and databases such as
        MongoDB and Postgresql for data storage required in the development of
        full-stack applications. <br />
        Recently, I&apos;m exploring <strong>Next.js</strong> as fullstack
        framework.
